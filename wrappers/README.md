1. Bulk Encryption Tool: The Bulk Encryption Tool is a command-line application that uses EDGETk as its backend to provide batch encryption capabilities. It allows for easy encryption and decryption of files using various encryption algorithms and modes of operation. Users can choose from a variety of algorithms, set key and mode parameters, and even apply a Key Derivation Function (KDF) algorithm to enhance security. It is a valuable tool for protecting sensitive data in bulk.

2. ECDH Key Exchange: The ECDH Key Exchange is an application that utilizes EDGETk to implement the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange algorithm. It enables two parties to securely share secrets even over an insecure channel. The application generates pairs of public and private keys, performs the key exchange, and then uses the shared keys to establish secure communication between the parties. It is a reliable choice for secure exchange of confidential information.

3. Message Authentication Code (MAC): The Message Authentication Code (MAC) Generator is a tool that uses EDGETk to generate message authentication codes (MACs) based on encryption algorithms. MACs are used to verify the integrity and authenticity of transmitted messages. This application allows users to choose from different MAC algorithms, input the message and key, and then generate the corresponding MAC. It is a valuable tool for ensuring communication security and data authenticity.
